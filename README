Algorithm Visualization

MATLAB code written to help visualize certain algorithms. At the moment, only the following search algorithms are supported in the form of maze navigation:
	-Depth first search
	-Breadth first search 
	-Greedy search
	-A* search

New algorithms will be added periodically, including a visualizer for expectation maximization (emgauss.m).	
	
Questions and comments are welcome.
